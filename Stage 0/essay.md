Single-cell sequencing is a revolutionary, transformative technique that allows researchers to investigate a single cell type and study its interactions within the body, unlike the bulk RNA-seq where it collects signals from thousands of mixed cells independent of their type (Picelli, 2016) (Kazim & Gande, 2024). This feature makes single cells sequencing a unique tool reshaping our understanding of biological systems providing a deeper and more accurate view of the biological system, which is boosting biotechnology and healthcare innovations (Wen et al., 2022).

Single-cell sequencing is based on isolating the genetic material from each cell separately, exposing its gene expression profile, functions, interactions, and mutations. It can reveal cell identity through genetic expression patterns that are unique to each cell type allowing us to differentiate between different cells within a tissue. This technique also helps us to find gene expressions of cells related to different diseases thus understanding their mechanisms (Picelli, 2016). Therefore, this technology has the potential to discover cellular signals that may contribute to illness and enhance diagnosis and therapeutic approaches (Kazim & Gande, 2024) (Wen et al., 2022).

Tissues can be composed of various types of cells, but even cells from the same type can behave differently. Single-cell analysis technology helps researchers understand cellular heterogeneity to better interpret how tissues develop, tumors grow, or how immune cells respond (Kazim & Gande, 2024).

Single-cell sequencing can give powerful insights into disease mechanisms (Kazim & Gande, 2024). For instance, in cancer, it can identify cancer stem cells or map tumor-immune interactions. It can also give insights about molecular changes during different stages of the disease, thus help us understand tumor progression (Lei et al., 2021). In Neurological diseases such as Parkinson or ALS, this technique can track subcellular molecular events contributing to degeneration, as well as the difference between cell degeneration mechanisms across multiple neurological disorders (Ahmadi et al., 2021).

As this technology extracts information from thousands of cells, data cannot be analyzed without computational approaches, making it essentially dependent on big data analysis and machine learning techniques, speeding up innovations in drug discovery and development and precision medicine (Yu & Lin, 2016).

In conclusion, this technology opens a new era in biotechnology and medicine, reshaping how we view and treat each cell as a unique entity. The advancements of this technology are leading to new discoveries in molecular biology, as well as innovations in medical diagnostics research and therapeutic strategies.
